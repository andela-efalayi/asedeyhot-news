#### Limitations
```block
- Presently, this news app can not share articles/headlines.
- News articles cannot viewed directly on the app.
```

***
#### Testing
All app components, actions, and stores were tested using [Facebook's Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
The test files can be found in the [__tests__ folder](src/__tests__).

- To run the tests, run `npm test` on the command line. This automatically runs `jest` on all test files.
- You can also run `jest` directly. However, [jest-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-cli) needs to be globally installed on your machine.
